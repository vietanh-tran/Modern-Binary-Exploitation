##lab2C.

In this challenge, we have to input a string as an argument which will then be copied to an array. Afterwards there's a conditional statement where it checks if the variable set_me is equal to 0xdeadbeef. If yes, we spawn a shell and complete the challenge.

With the help of the strcpy function, we can write past the bounds of the buffer "buf" into the variable set_me, which is conveniently placed next to our buffer. We have to keep in mind that in memory the values are little endian, therefore 0xdeadbeef will be written in our payload as "\xef\xbe\xad\xde". 

```bash
./lab2c `python -c 'print "A" * 15 + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"'`
1m_all_ab0ut_d4t_b33f
```
